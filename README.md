welcome adventurer!
the labyrinth has been overrun with
a strange and aggressive fungus
	
it contains a deadly toxin, so avoid it!
	
you have a few tools at your disposal:
  your sword (keyboard X or controller A)
  bombs (keyboard Z or controller B)
  a barrier (keyboard C or controller X)
	
you can move around with arrow keys or the D-pad.

this is what you look like -> @

when you destroy a fungus tile, it may
drop a useful item, such as:
  health refill ->       #
  bomb pickup ->         *
  max health upgrade ->  +
  sword range upgrade -> ^
  barrier pickup ->      $

before you begin your journey, remember:
  barriers will form a wall across the
  room, blocking the path of the fungi,
  however you can still walk across it

  you can only hold one barrier at a time

  bomb explosions don't harm you, but
  they explode in a large radius and
  destroy a lot of fungi in one go

  be aware of your health in the top right

  each time you move or act, the fungi may
  grow, but not when you turn on the spot

the bottom of the screen also shows some
useful information:
  d - direction you are facing
  b - bombs held
  r - melee range
  i - invincible turns
  q - quarantine barriers held

when you clear a room, no more fungi will
grow and the room will be safe from then on

however if you leave a room uncleared, it
will reset if you leave and re-enter it!

best of luck adventurer. you may need it.
